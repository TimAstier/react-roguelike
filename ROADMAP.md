## Spell ideas

- Wormhole. You use it on a wall, and it creates a temporary tunnel to the other side. It works like a normal corridor, but after some time it closes and places the wall tiles back. You can use it to skip rooms, to shoot through it, to make shortcuts, to escape from danger, or even lure monsters there and then let it close while they are inside so they get crushed by the wall.
- Clone. Creates your clone that you can control. Every turn you have to make a move for yourself, and then for your clone too. After some time it disappears.
- Time stop. For some time gives you infinite speed, or, in other words, stops everything except you. You are the only one who get to move. You can do sequential attacks, knowing for the next few turns no one can move. For monsters it will look just like you did it all in one turn.
- Wall. Well, it basically creates temporary wall. Or may be something more interesting, like it can only shift already existing walls. After some time everything returns to normal.
- Blink spell, the ability to teleport instantly a short distance.
- Stone Wall
